# Smart Floating Wetlands
A final project for the [Sensing the City](http://www.sensingthecity.com/) course at the University of Pennsylvania Weitzman School of Design by Sagari Datta, Suchang Dong, and John Michael LaSalle 

This project was a prototype of a smart floating wetland that would remediate water pollution from Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) in the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. The prototype was built with an Arduino and demonstrated in a [video](https://youtu.be/7QVBdDJvVTU) and [blog post](http://www.sensingthecity.com/sew-kill-smart-cso-monitoring-and-treatment-installation/).
