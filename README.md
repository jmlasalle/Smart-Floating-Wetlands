This project was a prototype of a smart floating wetland that would remediate water pollution from Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) in the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. The prototype was built with an Arduino and demonstrated in a [video](https://youtu.be/7QVBdDJvVTU) and [blog post](http://www.sensingthecity.com/sew-kill-smart-cso-monitoring-and-treatment-installation/).
